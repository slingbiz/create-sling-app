   - Create the Sling Frontend app by running the following command:
     ```sh
     yarn create sling-app my-project
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to configure your Sling app.

      

2. **Obtain Sling Studio Keys**

## üåê Setting up Sling - Self Hosted Studio

If you prefer to host Sling Studio on your local machine, follow these instructions. Sling consists of three main parts: Sling Studio, Sling API, and Sling FE.

     ```sh
     yarn create sling-app my-project
     ```

2. **Follow the prompts to configure your Sling app** by picking self hosted option. The starter script will start the services in the background but you can close it and start on your own.


3. **Open your browser and navigate to**:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:4087`
   - Studio: `http://localhost:2021`
   - API: `http://localhost:10001`
